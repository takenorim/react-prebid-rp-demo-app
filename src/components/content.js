                Austria has banned indoor events of more than 100 people and outdoor events of more than 500 people, Interior Minister Karl Nehammer confirmed.
                The country has also announced a ban on people arriving from Italy.
                "We are putting in place an entry ban for people from Italy to Austria, unless they have a doctor's certificate," chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Tuesday.
                Austrians in Italy will be allowed to return as long as they agree to a two-week home quarantine.
                Other measures announced by the government include stopping university lectures and encouraging companies to let employees work from home.
